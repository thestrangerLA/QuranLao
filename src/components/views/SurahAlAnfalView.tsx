And Allah is with the patient." },
    { number: "8:67", arabic: "Placeholder", lao: "Placeholder", english: "It is not for a prophet to have captives [of war] until he inflicts a massacre [upon Allah 's enemies] in the land.

And if they seek help of you for the religion, then you must help, except against a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty. And Allah is Seeing of what you do." },
